# Vibe Security Playbook — (condensed)

Purpose: Developer-first, pragmatic security playbook focused on fast iteration + high-signal controls.

## Principles:
- Least privilege everywhere
- Validate on server
- Ship small, patch fast
- Automate checks in CI
- Assume breach — detect & recover

## Quick Threat Model:
- **Actors**: external attackers, compromised deps, malicious insiders
- **Assets**: user data, credentials, admin interfaces
- **Outcomes**: data leak, account takeover, service disruption

## Core Controls:

### 1. Secrets Management
- Use environment variables; never commit secrets
- Use secret manager in production (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use different secrets per environment

### 2. Static Analysis
- Run lint + SAST in CI
- Use ESLint with security rules
- Run dependency vulnerability scans
- Fail builds on critical findings

### 3. Dependency Management
- Use Dependabot for automated updates
- Run `npm audit` in CI
- Pin dependency versions
- Review and test updates before merging

### 4. Runtime Security Headers
- CSP (Content Security Policy)
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- Use established libraries (Passport.js, JWT)
- Implement MFA where possible
- Use strong password policies
- Implement proper session management

### 6. Logging & Monitoring
- Redact PII from logs
- Centralize logs
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for security events

### 7. CI/CD Security
- Fail builds on critical SAST findings
- Sign artifacts
- Enable canary deployments
- Implement rollback procedures

### 8. Incident Response
- **Identify**: Detect and assess the incident
- **Isolate**: Contain the threat
- **Rotate**: Change compromised credentials
- **Restore**: Restore services safely
- **Notify**: Inform stakeholders
- Record post-mortems for learning

## 30/90 Day Rollout Plan:

### Days 0–7: Foundation
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Basic CI with lint and tests
- [ ] Environment variable rules
- [ ] Dependabot configuration
- [ ] Basic security headers

### Days 8–30: Enhanced Security
- [ ] SAST integration (Semgrep/Bandit)
- [ ] Central logging setup
- [ ] RBAC skeleton implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Days 31–90: Advanced Controls
- [ ] Security gating in CI
- [ ] Canary deployments
- [ ] Scheduled dependency upgrades
- [ ] Security testing (pentest)
- [ ] Incident response procedures

## Contact:
See SECURITY.md for reporting security issues.

## Implementation Status:
- [x] Security middleware implemented
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configured
- [x] CI pipeline with security checks
- [x] Dependabot configured
- [x] Security documentation created
- [ ] RBAC implementation (planned)
