# MedFlect AI - Code Quality & Deployment Preparation PR

## Overview

This PR implements comprehensive debugging, simplification, and deployment preparation for the MedFlect AI healthcare analytics platform. All changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving code quality, security, and deployment reliability.

## üéØ Objectives Completed

### ‚úÖ 1. Stack Detection & Baseline
- **Detected**: Node.js/TypeScript project with React frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (configured with only-allow)
- **Testing**: Vitest (configured but no tests found initially)
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, TypeScript compiler for backend

### ‚úÖ 2. Configuration Files Added
- **`.eslintrc.js`** - Comprehensive ESLint configuration with TypeScript and React rules
- **`.prettierrc`** - Code formatting configuration
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **`env.example`** - Environment variable template
- **`vitest.config.ts`** - Test configuration with coverage thresholds

### ‚úÖ 3. Test Infrastructure Created
- **`tests/setup.ts`** - Test environment setup with database configuration
- **`tests/smoke/health.spec.ts`** - Health endpoint smoke tests
- **`tests/smoke/api.spec.ts`** - API functionality smoke tests
- **Coverage thresholds**: 70% for branches, functions, lines, statements

### ‚úÖ 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed 9 console.log statements** in `server/routes.ts` - replaced with proper Winston logging
- **Enhanced error handling** with structured error responses
- **Improved type safety** by addressing `any` types where possible
- **Added proper logging** throughout the application

### ‚úÖ 5. Docker & Deployment Artifacts
- **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage production build optimized for size and security
- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Production environment (already well-configured)
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml`** - Development environment
- **`Makefile`** - Common development and deployment commands

### ‚úÖ 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Comprehensive CI pipeline with:
  - Linting and type checking
  - Test execution with PostgreSQL service
  - Docker build and smoke tests
  - Security auditing with TruffleHog

### ‚úÖ 7. Documentation
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide (updated by user)
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Detailed changelog documenting all improvements
- **`PR_SUMMARY.md`** - This comprehensive PR summary

### ‚úÖ 8. Package Management
- **Updated `package.json`** with new scripts:
  - `test:smoke` - Run smoke tests
  - `lint:check` - Check linting without fixing
  - `format:check` - Check formatting without fixing
  - `check:ci` - CI-specific checks
  - `docker:*` - Docker-related commands
  - `health` - Health check command

## üîß Technical Improvements
